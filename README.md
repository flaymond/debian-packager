## packdeb
A few scripts to packaging simple Debian .deb package.

## Note

* This program/scripts work with interpreted languages including bash(zsh and ksh need tweaks), Python, Ruby, Lua, Pike and Perl.

* This program can be used with Java packaging (the end program need to be a JAR), Go (you can put shebang line in the programs), and D (also can put shebang line).

* This program/scripts is only for simple debian packaging.

* For advanced use, you need to tweak the scripts to complete your task.

* Refer to the README.md file in scripts directory for tutorial to setup the program.


## TODO
* Make the program use 1 script only, and not 3 for ease of use.
